## 6551-CTG-VAULT

An ERC-6551-compatible smart contract account to help Will Hunter win CTG Season 02.

Jury token owners can send their tokens to the token-bound account of Will's CTG Player token to grant him more votes in the finale. If Will wins, the original Jury token owners will recieve their proportionate amount of the pot (relative to how many tokens they sent).

No matter what, Jury token owners can withdraw their tokens after the game is over.
